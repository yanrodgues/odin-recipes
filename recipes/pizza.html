    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a great option if you're looking for a quick and yummy meal to share with family or friends. 
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>400g plain flour, plus extra to dust</li>
            <li>1 x 7g sachet fast action dried yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to dizzle</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornmeal, polenta or semolina, to roll out</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Step by step</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to the hottest it will go (around 240°C, fan 220°C, gas 9), before starting to make the dough.<br> Put in a couple of pizza stones, or 2 large baking trays, to get really hot.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, yeast, salt and sugar together in a mixing bowl. <br>Make a well in the centre and add the oil, then add about 225ml water to bring together as a dough.<br> Tip out onto a floured surface and knead for 1 minute, just until smooth. Leave to rest under the upturned bowl while you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>It’s time to shape the pizzas! Roll out one ball at a time on a lightly floured surface, to about 25cm in diameter. <br>Sprinkle a large square of baking paper with the cornmeal (or alternative) then lift the dough onto the paper. <br>Stretch and press the pizza dough with your fingertips until it is about 30cm diameter, indenting a thicker crust around the edges. <br>The middle should be about 5mm, and the crust about 1cm deep. Repeat to make a second pizza.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizzas with sauce and add your toppings (don’t add too many, or you’ll end up with a soggy pizza). <br>Drizzle with a little oil and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking, so that the dough starts to rise.<br> Slide the pizzas onto the preheated pizza stones or hot baking trays, still on the lining paper to help lift them easily. <br>Bake for 10-15 minutes until the base is golden and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
